	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Cline-1^N
			%description = Cline-1 was the first star to have planets discovered around it by the CLear ImagiNg Equipment telescope, and thus carries its name. It is an M1V class red dwarf with five known planets. 
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[Cline1/f]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Cline-1f^N
			%description = Cline-1f is the smallest planet in the system, and was the last to be discovered, despite being the innermost planet in the system. Like the other inner worlds of Cline-1, it's probably tidally locked. It is likely quite warm, but may have a band of habitable conditions along the terminator. It was discovered by the radial velocity method, so its mass and radius are not well constrained.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[Cline1/c]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Cline-1c^N
			%description = Cline-1c is the most habitable of the planets in the Cline-1 system, and like the other inner planets, is probably tidally locked, with a hot desert on one side and an ice cap on the other side. It was discovered by the radial velocity method, so its mass and radius are not well constrained.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[Cline1/e]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Cline-1e^N
			%description = Cline-1e and Cline-1d were, for a long time, thought to be a single planet. It took complex measurements of Cline-1's radial velocity to determine the effect that the planet had on the other planet orbits, and that it made no sense for a single body. And so, both worlds are now known to be trojans, sharing an orbit 60 degrees apart. Like the other inner planets, they're probably tidally locked.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[Cline1/d]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Cline-1d^N
			%description = Cline-1d and Cline-1e were, for a long time, thought to be a single planet. It took complex measurements of Cline-1's radial velocity to determine the effect that the planet had on the other planet orbits, and that it made no sense for a single body. And so, both worlds are now known to be trojans, sharing an orbit 60 degrees apart. Like the other inner planets, they're probably tidally locked.

	@Body:HAS[#identifier[Cline1/b]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Cline-1b^N
			%description = Cline-1b was the first planet discovered around Cline-1, and was the only known planet for a long time. It was discovered by radial velocity, so while we do have a good minimum mass--it's clearly a super-gas-giant planet--it could be much more massive.

	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[Cline1/bI]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Cline-1b I^N
			%description = Cline-1b is known to have three large moons, as measured through slight variations in Cline-1's radial velocity over time, as Cline-1b wobbles back and forth in its orbit.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[Cline1/bII]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Cline-1b II^N
			%description = Cline-1b is known to have three large moons, as measured through slight variations in Cline-1's radial velocity over time, as Cline-1b wobbles back and forth in its orbit.
		}
	}
	@Body:HAS[#identifier[Cline1/bIII]]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Cline-1b III
			%description = Cline-1b is known to have three large moons, as measured through slight variations in Cline-1's radial velocity over time, as Cline-1b wobbles back and forth in its orbit.
